# Credit Card Dashboard

It's good to share a recent project I worked on a Credit Card Dashboard built using Power BI, with data connected from a MySQL server. This dashboard is divided into two main reports: Transaction Report and Customer Report, offering a comprehensive overview of key metrics related to credit card usage.
